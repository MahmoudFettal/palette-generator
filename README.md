# How to support the project:
**:thumbsup: Your support means a lot. Thank you for stars that keeps me motivated to share new ideas and do them fast.**

You can support also the project by [buy me a coffe](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mahmoudfettal), that would help with the costs of hosting and keep me motivated to add new features in the future. 

# Lisence:
You can clone the repos easily but you will have to create your own APIs in order for the app to work.

Contact me if you need help.
